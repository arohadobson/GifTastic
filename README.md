# Giftastic API

Giftastic uses API calls and bootstrap to make a fun and interactive search engine.

## How To Search

This application already has pre-assigned (adorable) animal buttons that users can choose from to load a plethora of gifs from the Giphy. However, if you'd like to add more queries just type it into the search bar on the right of the screen and add it to the collection!
